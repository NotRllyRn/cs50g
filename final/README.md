# Cat Cafe Haven

## Main menu

The first thing I started to work on was the menu state. I wanted this to be visually appealing and easy to use in a multitude of ways. The menu should show the title of the game obviously, and what you need to press. I decided to go with 3 simple buttons. Play, Quit, and Credits. You can use your mouse to select the buttons and there is an arrow showing you what you are hovering over. You could also use your keyboard arrows or 'a', 'd' keys to move the pointer left and right. This allows for multiple different types of inputs in the main menu. This took a lot of work with 'GUI' elements. I had to make Backdrops, Text, TextButtons, and Selection elements. 

For the visual appeal, I decided to take a cute cat pack that had donut tiles in it and have them slide across the screen in some way. I wanted the game to have a cute asthetic so I choose a pink background. I coded it so that the donuts are moved from the top left to the bottom right. I coded it so that you could adjust the speed at which they move. The cool thing is that this doesn't lag the game over time. I am not creating any new objects. When the code detects that the donut is off the screen, it will actually move it back to the top left and it will start the loop over. This is very visually appealing and is very cute which is the theme that I was going for.
